I had an opportunity to work with Kalpesh for a couple of years and I can say without any reservations that his impact was felt immediately after he joined. His breadth and depth of knowledge in technologies ranging from virtualization to operating systems and web technologies is truly impressive. Almost immediately, Kalpesh became the technical expert whose advice and recommendations were seeked for all projects, big and small. Easily approachable and always willing to help, Kalpesh was a valuable assest to me and my team throughout his tenure. I would gladly work with him again if an opportunity presented itself.
